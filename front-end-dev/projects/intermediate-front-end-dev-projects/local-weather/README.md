# Local Weather App

This is the app we’ve all done a million times. Scaffolded a simple Express backend using express-generator, and a React frontend with create-react-app. Inside package.json under client, you’ll see the proxy key. That key must match the server, which is specified using PORT=3001 inside package.json under the server directory.

To run:

```
$ cd client
$ yarn start
```
